Firstly, we import the tidyverse.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Then, the data should be read. It is assigned to **revenue_data.**

```{r, message=FALSE}
revenue_data <- read_csv("data/Revenue_Chart_Full_Data_data.csv")
```

*Year (copy)*, *Format*, *Value (Actual)* columns are renamed below.  

```{r}
colnames(revenue_data)
```

As you can see above, we need to change 4th, 15th and 16th elements.  

We can select these elements with **colnames** function and rename with **paste** function.

```{r}
colnames(revenue_data)[c(4, 15, 16)] <- paste(c("Format",
                                                "Value",
                                                "Year"))
```

If we print out the column names again, it can be seen the column names are renamed succesfully.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
colnames(revenue_data)
```
